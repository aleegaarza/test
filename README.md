# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install all dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run api`

Runs the API in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3500] to view json file in your browser

### `What did you like the most about your development?`

I really enjoy being able to develop applications that involve facing challenges, I like to apply my knowledge as well as reinforce it and learn new things.

### `If you had had more time, what would you have improved or what else would you have done? `

If I had more time, I would have added the mobile part with the use of a custom hook as I have applied in previous projects, \
improving the styles by showing the cards and updating without having to reload the page, as well as refactoring my code.

### `Describe a pain point or bug with which you have encountered and how you solved it`

I had an error when making the request to the api since it was calling a different url than the one I had generated from the json server, \
I corrected it by changing the path and adding a new script to execute this json file inside the json package
